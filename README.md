# AutomationTurn
#### Gilberto SÃ¡nchez Mares

## **1. Introduction**
The test automation framework was create in order to complete the Turn QA challenge, you can use the classes in order to create your own framework or combine with unit testing framework like TestNG or Junit.

You only need to download the project anr run it (Steps explained in future topics) the results generated by this framework are:

1. HTML report
2. Screenshots on error

Requirements you need in your computer:
- Admin rights on your computer to download and install apps.
- Chocolatey package manager (only windows and optional)
- Java JDK >1.8
- Maven 3.5.0
- IntelliJ, Eclipse Luna or above or another java IDE.
- Supported browsers as of now: Chrome, but you can download and save the drivers (on drivers folder) for IE11, Firefox, Edge and Safari and the framework works.

## **2. Solving the Problem**
As a rule in any test automation area, is very important execute test cases manually at least one time, but test cases was not created previously, the right approach was perform an _Exploratory Testing_.

Exploratory testing, is all about discovery, investigation and learning. It emphasizes on personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester. Test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly. They may note down ideas about what to test before test execution. The focus of exploratory testing is more on testing as a "thinking" activity.

After exploratory testing was executed, different flows was created and implemented as automated test cases. The creation of the test automation framework and selection tools start (You can see the tools used in topic No. 3).

## **3. Features and Solution**
the tools and programming language used on this project are:

1. Java as Programming Language
2. Selenium WebDriver as Automation Framework
3. TestNG as Unit Test Framework
4. Page Factory as Automation Pattern Design
5. Maven as Tool for compiling and execution

The project has reusable modules that you can implement in other projects, the modularity helps to an easy maintenance and a great test coverage.

But why use this tools?

**Java:** Java is a highly portable language as it must be executed through a cross-platform compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).Furthermore, Android apps are also developed using Java since the Android Operating System runs on a Java language environment.

**Selenium:** Unlike other automation tools which make java script injection to the browser for execution of basic operations, webdriver make direct calls to browser native support. What that means that we are not injecting operations or data into the browser but we are performing the operation just like another user.

**TestNG:** TestNG is a Testing framework that overcomes the limitations of another popular testing framework called JUnit. The "NG" means "Next Generation." Most Selenium users use this more than Junit because of its advantages. There are so many features of TestNG:
  - Annotations are easier to understand
  - Test cases can be grouped more easily
  - Parallel testing is possible

**Maven:** Maven, different from other build tools, knows the software development life cycle. It knows that testing need to be executed after the code is compiled and not before. Test code and other third party libraries used only for testing are only required during testing and thus these should not be part of the final product and Maven leaves them out when packaging the application. 
## **4. Steps to Execute**
the tools and programming language used on this project are:

### **4.1 Installing Java and Maven**
If you have installed Java (1.8 or above) and Maven (3.5 or above), skip this section

**Chocolatey installation**

Visit https://chocolatey.org/install and follow the installation steps.

**Java Installation**
1. Open a command line as administrator.
2. Copy and paste: **choco install jre8**
3. Wait a few second, then one question about run an script will appear
4. Type *y*and press enter.
5. Wait for the command to complete.
6. If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Java

**Maven Installation**
1. Open a command line as administrator.
2. Copy and paste: **choco install maven**
3. Wait a few second, then one question about run an script will appear
4. Type *y* and press enter.
5. Wait for the command to complete.
6. If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Java

### **4.2 Executing the framework**
1. Clone (if you have git installed on your  system) or download as Zip the project in your preferred location from https://github.com/gsanchezm/AutomationTurn.git
2. Go to your project root (AutomationTurn) folder (the _pom_ file must be visible). Below you will find the project structure
   - AutomationTun
   - .git
   - drivers (ChomeDriver is stored here)
   - resources (Test data file is on this folder)
   - src (all the code and logic is there)
   - .gitignore
   - extent-config.xml
   - pom.xml
   - README.md
   - testng.xml
3. Open a console (admin rights recommended)
4. Execute the commands one after the other:
    - `mvn clean` 
    - `mvn validate` 
    - `mvn compile`
    - `mvn test`
4. Wait for your test to finish.

## **5. Results**
After the execution, one results folder is created on the project structure, inside will find the HTML Report and screenshot if one failure is found.

The HTML file opens automatically when the execution finish and show you the complete summary of test steps/cases passed or failed:

If the test case fails, the framework will take an screenshot and embed in the report, you only need to click over the image embedded and will be displayed
